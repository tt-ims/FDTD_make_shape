[SALMON](https://salmon-tddft.jp/) has a FDTD functionality to simulate electromagnetic problems. This program makes the input shape file.

## Requirements

 - Python 3

If you are windows user who uses python for the first time, I recommend to install [WinPython](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/) that includes all requirements for this program.
